_Writing and maintaining software is hard. Let's try to take it easy on each other._

Hello, my name is Richard Bown. You'll usually find me talking about software engineering and DevOps on [my consultancy website](https://richardwbown.com) or over on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-bown/).

For my day job, I'm a Consulting DevOps engineer who works with software teams to improve their software delivery (CI/CD, environments and automation) while also teaching them to be more pleasant to each other.

I believe in [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law). In other words, I believe that our IT and software systems map our organisational constraints.
I advocate for more pleasant interactions at work and through my work, I've come into contact and work with the good folks over at [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/).


## Human Software

I'm currently writing my first book about software engineering called [Human Software](https://humansoftware.page). Inspired by books such as **The Unicorn Project** and **The Phoenix Project**, I wanted to dive deeper into  the human connections that we forge at work and how they relate to our home lives.

Head over to the [Human Software](https://humansoftware.page) website to sign up to my newsletter to stayed informed about updates.
