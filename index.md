Hello, my name is Richard Bown.

I’m a software engineer who works with teams to improve software delivery (CI/CD, environments and
automation) while making the process of work, more pleasant, more empowering and more inclusive.

I believe in Conway’s Law. In other words, I believe that our IT and software systems reflect our organisational
and interpersonal constraints. I advocate for clearer, fairer interactions which more closely reflect the
problems we're trying to solve.

You’ll usually find me talking about software engineering and DevOps over on
[my consultancy website](https://richardwbown.com) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-bown/).


If you could sum up my attitude in a couple of sentences it would be this:

__Writing and maintaining software is hard. Let’s try to take it easy on each other.__
